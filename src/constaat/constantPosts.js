            info: "The JavaScript Encapsulation is a process of binding the data (i.e. variables) with the functions acting on that data. It allows us to control the data and validate it. To achieve an encapsulation in JavaScript: Use var keyword to make data members private. Use setter methods to set the data and getter methods to get that data. The encapsulation allows us to handle an object using the following properties: Read/Write - Here, we use setter methods to write the data and getter methods read that data. Read Only - In this case, we use getter methods only. Write Only - In this case, we use setter methods only.",

Here, we’ll cover them in general and in the next chapters we’ll talk about each of them in detail. We can put any type in a variable. Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.",

Someone who creates anagrams may be called an anagrammatist, and the goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to produce anagrams that reflect or comment on their subject.",

Browsers not supporting strict mode will run strict mode code with different behavior from browsers that do, so don't rely on strict mode without feature-testing for support for the relevant aspects of strict mode. Strict mode code and non-strict mode code can coexist, so scripts can opt into strict mode incrementally.",
